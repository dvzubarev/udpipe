Python UDPipe Bindings
======================

UDPipe library bindings is available in the
[``ufal.udpipe`` http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ufal.udpipe] module.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the ``C++`` bindings API,
just native ``bytes`` type is used instead of the ``C++`` ``Bytes`` type.

You might also be interested in a contributed package
[spacy-udpipe https://github.com/TakeLab/spacy-udpipe] which wraps UDPipe
with spaCy API.
